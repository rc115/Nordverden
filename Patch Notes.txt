    * Game crashes on non-int inputs on the resistances
    * nextInt is used instead of nextDouble for some reason

* Added framework for status effects, both positive and negative effects (currently only works on player, and might stay that way :\ )
* Added a dragon to the debug area you just cant get there anymore tho...
* Worst part is, this is still basically just the framework of the game, there is still no story implimentation other than the tutorial
* Theres also a bunch of "Chekov's guns" everywhere which need to be added in some way (EX: Literally all weapons and spells)
* Bugs are also in every crack they can get into but more play testing is needed to get an idea of how to fix them (Also too lazy to fix the easy ones like in the Character creator)
