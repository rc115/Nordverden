Project: Nordverden

This project was started as a concept for a CS2011 final
the assignment was to make a text-based adventure game
in Java using the materials we learned in class.

About Nordverden:
* This game was inspired by open-world rpgs by Interplay and Bethesda
* Nordverden is set in a Neomedieval fantasy world with 80s technology available in certain areas
* "Nordverden" roughly translates to "North-world" in norwegian
* Several names and locations can be translated as well (EX: Nekomura â‰ˆ Cat-Village)
* Several factions in the game are loosely based on different ciltures around the world
    * Verdians are based on Nordic countries and were mostly inspired by Vikings
    * Empirians are based on Romans, Greeks, and midieval european countries
    * Nekohito are based on east asian cultures like ancient China, modern Japan, and even the Russian Empire
    * Orcs, Elves, and dragonborn are the exeptions and were all inspired by fantasy races popularized by DND
* Verdians are the native inhabitants of Nordverden
    * Verdians differ from their scandanavian inspirations by not being seafairing raiders (anymore?)
    * They are ruled by a King and Lords
    * Verdians are strong warriors who will take arms to defend their land if needed
* Empirians are ruled by an Emperor of the Western Empire (very creative ik)
    * The most recent emperor, Brutus IV, was given the epithes "the wise" for killing his father with a book
    * A colony was established on the west coast 4 years before the game starts which started the Empiri-Verdi war
    * Empirians have their own currency and strive to get as much of it as possible for a chance to gain power in the empire
* Nekohito were originally inspired by khajiit from The Elder Scrolls
    * Nekomura is an isolated island to the east of Nordverden and the home of the Nekohito
    * Nekomura is also the only democracy in Nordverden
    * They are neutral in the Empiri-Verdi war despite their close proximity
    * They are also the most advanced civilization in Nordverden
    * Despite their isolation Nekohito trade routes with Nordverden have brought riches and technology to the mainland
* Orcs are the only uncivilized playable characters
   * They are based on a combination of Super Mutants from the Fallout franchise and Orks from Warhammer 40k
   * Orcs are extremely loyal to eachother, but are hostile to most non-orcs
   * Despite being considered unintelligent by many in Nordverden some have learned to communicate with non-orcs
   * They're most used resource are rocks found near their mountainous home
   * Orcs were exterminted on the Western Empire motherland, but are usually not considered a threat in Nordverden
* Dark Elves and Wood Elves were at war for thousands of years before the events of the game
   * Dark Elves were driven to hide in caves by the Wood Elfs with the help of the Verdians
   * Wood Elves hid their homeworld within a large forrest to the east of Nordverden
   * Dark Elfs are generally better magic casters than Wood Elfs
   * Both types are weaker than the other races in Nordverden
* Dragonborn have the ability to aquire the power dragons they defeat
   * Dragonborn would hunt dragons for sport and honor
   * Dragonborn, like Verdians and Empirians, are a human race that had their own culture and ancient civilizations
   * This race was nearly wiped out by dragons for their atrocities agains them
   * Despite dragons being indipendant Drakung the dragon king used his power to unite the dragons
