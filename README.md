Project: Nordverden

This project was started as a concept for a CS2011 final
the assignment was to make a text-based adventure game
in Java using the materials we learned in class.

About Nordverden:
* This game was inspired by open-world rpgs by Interplay and Bethesda
* Nordverden is set in a Neomedieval fantasy world with modern technology available in certain areas (magic and guns type shi)
* "Nordverden" roughly translates to "North-world" in norwegian
* Several names and locations can be translated as well (EX: Nekomura â‰ˆ Cat-Village)
* Several factions in the game are loosely based on different ciltures around the world
    * Verdians are based on Nordic countries and were mostly inspired by Vikings
    * Empirians are based on Romans, Greeks, and midieval european countries
    * Nekohito are based on east asian cultures like ancient China, modern Japan, and even the Russian Empire
    * Orcs, Elves, and dragonborn are the exeptions and were all inspired by fantasy races popularized by DND
* Verdians are the native inhabitants of Nordverden
    * Verdians differ from their scandanavian inspirations by not being seafairing raiders (anymore?)
    * They are ruled by a King and Lords
    * Verdians are strong warriors who will take arms to defend their land if needed
* Empirians are ruled by an Emperor of the Western Empire (very creative ik)
    * The most recent emperor, Brutus IV, was given the epithes "the wise" for killing his father with a book
    * A colony was established on the west coast 4 years before the game starts which started the Empiri-Verdi war
    * Empirians have their own currency and strive to get as much of it as possible for a chance to gain power in the empire
* Nekohito were originally inspired by khajiit from The Elder Scrolls
    * Nekomura is an isolated island to the east of Nordverden and the home of the Nekohito
    * Nekomura is also the only democracy in Nordverden
    * They are neutral in the Empiri-Verdi war despite their close proximity
    * They are also the most advanced civilization in Nordverden
    * Despite their isolation Nekohito trade routes with Nordverden have brought riches and technology to the mainland
