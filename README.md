Project: Nekomura Slums/ Nordverden: SoN

This project was started as a concept for a CS2011 final
the assignment was to make a text-based adventure game
in Java using the materials we learned in class.

About Nekomura Slums:
* Based off Nordverden v0.026 but changed heavily to comply with the CS2011 Final restrictions
* Main reason Nordverden wasn't allowed because it relied on ArrayLists
* Nekomura Slums is meant to be a lot simpler compared to Nordverden
   * Follows a linear storyline rather than being open-world
   * Character creator was diluted and simplified
   * Combat is diluted
   * Inventory was removed
   * Magic was removed
   * Companion sytem was removed
   * Missle Logic was removed
   * NPCs are simplified
   * Allies were removed
* Storyline idea is to learn about what happened to the old world
