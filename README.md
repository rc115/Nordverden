"I have no clue if I'll be able to do this ngl
I'm either really ambitious or delusional" - Rigo (Main Dev)

Gonna start adding patch notes here ig

Update 8 --- Oct. 3rd, 2024:
* Added comments to almost everything to make it more understandable
* Started working on phase 2 of the stat distribution (currently bugged badly)
* Moved methods and variables to be neater
* Finished phase 1 of the character creator (skill distribution)
* Critical bugs include:
    * Game crashes whenever an invalid input is entered when the user is prompted to enter their skill points
    * Game crashes on non-int inputs on the resistances
    * nextInt is used instead of nextDouble for some reason
* Still very early alpha would not even consider this as "Game" at this point
* List of things needed would be too long to include so ill include the link to the spreadsheet of ideas below
* Spreadsheet of ideas: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skmt_pbT3vvZ0yztQ135bosPSbpcWVjASjwLznJw5q8/edit?usp=sharing
* Hopefully I can finish the important bits by the end of November
